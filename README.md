# AI Supply Chain Analytics

[
[
[

An end-to-end **AI-powered supply chain analytics system** that automates data collection, performs intelligent analysis, and generates actionable insights to optimize supply chain operations, improve delivery performance, and reduce operational costs.

***

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates a modern approach to supply chain management by leveraging AI and automation tools to solve real-world operational challenges. The system automatically:

- **Collects** order data from email attachments
- **Stores** data in a cloud PostgreSQL database
- **Cleans** and transforms data using AI-generated Python code
- **Analyzes** supply chain performance through 15+ KPIs
- **Generates** business insights and recommendations

### Business Problem

Supply chain operations often face challenges like:
- Late deliveries impacting customer satisfaction
- Incomplete order fulfillment causing revenue loss
- Lack of real-time visibility into performance metrics
- Manual data processing leading to delays and errors

### Solution

This automated analytics pipeline provides:
- **Real-time monitoring** of supply chain KPIs (OTIF, Fill Rates, Cycle Time)
- **Predictive insights** for demand planning and inventory optimization
- **Automated reporting** reducing manual effort by 10-15x
- **Data-driven recommendations** for operational improvements

   ```bash
   # Option 1: npm
   npm install n8n -g
   
   # Option 2: Docker
   docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
   ```

2. **Import Workflow**

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Data Pipeline

#### 1. Start n8n Workflow

```bash
# Start n8n
n8n start

# The workflow will automatically:
# - Monitor Gmail inbox for vendor emails
# - Extract CSV attachments
# - Load data into PostgreSQL tables
```

#### 2. Load Sample Data (Optional)

```bash
# Load sample order data
python scripts/load_sample_data.py

# This will populate:
# - fact_orders_aggregate
# - fact_order_line
# - dim_customers
# - dim_products
```

#### 3. Run Data Cleaning & Analysis

Open Quadratic and execute AI prompts:

**Create Date Table:**
```
Create a date table that has dates from 03-01-2025 to 05-31-2025
```

**Create Exchange Rate Table:**
```
Create exchange_rate table for March 1 to May 17, 2025 
using Open Exchange Rates API
```

**Generate fact_summary Table:**
```
Create Python code that:
1. Loads data from fact_order_line, dim_products, dim_customers, exchange_rate
2. Cleans data (convert IDs to integers, remove nulls, standardize dates)
3. Merges tables on product_id, customer_id, order_placement_date
4. Calculates total_amount_inr (handles USD/INR conversion)
5. Creates calculated columns: backorder_qty, order_cycle_time_days, 
   delivery_delay_days, in_full_percent, on_time_flag
```

#### 4. Calculate Supply Chain KPIs

```
Create the following KPIs:
1. Total Order Lines
2. Line Fill Rate
3. Volume Fill Rate
4. Total Orders
5. On Time Delivery %
6. In Full Delivery %
7. On Time In Full %
8. Order Cycle Time
9. Backorder Rate
10. Lead Time Variability
```

#### 5. Generate Business Insights

```
Show top 5 customers based on order value and their OTIF%, IF%, OT%.
Include customer_name, customer_id, and city
```

```
Filter the most recent 4 weeks. Aggregate by category: 
total backorder_qty, average in_full_percent, and average delivery_delay_days.
Return the five categories with highest backorder_qty
```
